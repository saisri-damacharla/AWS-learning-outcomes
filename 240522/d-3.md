### What is EC2?

  EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute
  
  Compute = CPU + RAM + Disk = Virtual Server

  As EC2 can scale up and down according to its' resource availabilty, so it is elastic in nature

**EC2 - Requesting AWS for a virtual server in cloud platform which should be elastic**

### Why EC2?

  To avoid timely upgrades, security issues and server maintanence

  Using EC2 helps in managament efforts and cost optimization

### What are EC2 Instances?
 - General purpose: These kind of instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memeory and network resources. 
 - Copmute optimized: These instances handle compute intensive workloads like batch processing, gaming servers, high performance web servers.
 - Memory optimized: These instances handle memory intensive workloads like real time big data analytics, im-memory data bases.
 - Storage optimized: These instances manage large datasets like data warehousing, log processing, distributed file sytem.
 - Accelerated Compute: These are computing instances with one or more accelator types like GPU's, IPGA's, ACIS's

***As DevOps Engineer we need to take security & latency aspects into consideration while delivering an end product.***
Region - Where the data centers are present
Availabity Zone - Each region have multiple az's to provide highly availablity functionality

# Hands-on: Launch an EC2 instance and deploy Jenkins from EC2 and check it's accessability.
  Step-1: Login to AWS management consloe, navigate EC2 instance
  
  Step-2: Launch a new EC2 Instance by adding appropriate details

  Step-3: For accessing the EC2 instance from windows machine download & install mobaxterm, navigate to session, in an SSH session provide the public IP address of EC2 Instance,
    in avdanced setting provide the private key(add .pem file) which should allow to connect private IP address of EC2 instance.

  Step-4: Dowload and install jenkins in EC2 instance from mobaxterm terminal

  Step-5: Try to access the jenkins app from windows machine

  Step-6: Modify the inbound security rules in EC2 Instance
